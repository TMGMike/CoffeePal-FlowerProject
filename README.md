CoffeePal EPoS System - Team Project Assignment
==================================================

Welcome to the coffee shop EPoS System.
This was a second-year Team Project assignment. Many of the functions were not completed as intended; most of the API was meant to be stored in a database, but due to the unfortunate team I was in, and running out of time, the data had to be hard-coded in the application for the demonstration.
